# HistoricalDanceAnimator
A tool I'm working on to make it easier to animate and sync historical dances to music.

The goal is to make a user-friendly interface to create these animations from premade pieces (steps, dance moves, different formations etc.).

Currently the dances I've included are.
- John Gardiner-Garden: The Chess Dance (historically-styled but modern)
- Lord Iulstan Sigewealding: Hole in the Wall (historically-styled but modern)
- Playford: Heralds in Love
- Playford: Parson's Farewell

There are also some older premade animations for these historically-styled but modern dances
- John Gardiner-Garden: Past, Present and Future dance
- Kaarina Lepp√§lahti: Sashes are Green and Ribbons are Blue
- Lari Unkari: Scallywags
- Lari Unkari: Walpurgisnacht

As time passes I will create more dances in instructions format of course, especially of real historical ones.

# Why?
I'm a historical dancer and amateur teacher of historical dances in a local group. I've also taken up the challenge to choreograph my own dances and I've created three so far.

Scallywags is quite a complex dance and it was hard to keep it all in my mind during the creation process, when it was still changing a lot. I started creating the animation for it just to keep track of all the movements. It wasn't easy to sync the music to it so I made a script to do just that. That became the first version of this tool. Now it's based on predefined dance actions written in a timeline within a JSON file.

# Goal
Teaching dances in person isn't that hard. However, if you can't make it to practice in person you really might need a video of the dance to be able to learn it. And some just learn the floor patterns better with these kinds of visual aids. Unfortunately most videos found online aren't too good in quality, if you can even find one, or they might be of some other local version of the same dance and therefore not that helpful to you.

While the current choreography data system is rather flexible, it's not that convenient for humans to write and read. I am going to make a visual interface inside the tool to script the dances without ever having to go into the JSON data.

I hope that one day this tool can be used to easily create comprehensive animations for all popular historical and similarly styled dances around the world.
