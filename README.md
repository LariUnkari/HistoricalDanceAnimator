# HistoricalDanceAnimator
A tool I'm working on to make it easier to animate and sync historical dances to music.

The goal is to make a user-friendly interface to create these animations from premade pieces (steps, dance moves, different formations etc.). Currently the dances I've included are entirely custom with only the verses and choruses as pieces.

- John Gardiner-Garden: Past, Present and Future dance
- Kaarina Leppälahti: Sashes are Green and Ribbons are Blue
- Lari Unkari: Scallywags

These dances also aren't actual historical dances but modern ones made in style of historical dances. As time passes I will create more of course and of real historical ones.

# Why?
I'm a historical dancer and amateur teacher of historical dances in a local group. More recently I've also taken up the challenge to choreograph my own dances and I've created two so far.

Scallywags is quite a complex dance and it was hard to keep it all in my mind during the creation process, when it was still changing a lot. I started creating the animation for it just to keep track of all the movements. It wasn't easy to sync the music to it so I made a script to do just that. That became the first version of this tool.

# Goal
Teaching dances in person isn't that hard. However, if you can't make it to practice in person you really might need a video of the dance to be able to learn it. Unfortunately most videos online aren't too good in quality, if you can even find one, or they might be of some other local version of the same dance and therefore not that helpful to you.

I hope that one day this tool can be used to easily create comprehensive animations for all popular historical dances around the world.
