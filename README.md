# HistoricalDanceAnimator
A tool I'm working on to make it easier to animate and sync historical dances to music.

The goal is to make a user-friendly interface to create these animations from premade pieces (steps, dance moves, different formations etc.). Currently the dances I've included are entirely custom with only the verses and choruses as pieces.

These included dances also aren't actually historical dances but modern ones made in style of historical dances. As time passes I will create more of course and of real historical ones.
